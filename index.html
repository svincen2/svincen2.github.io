    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>This here's a website showcasing some stuff I've done.  Oh I'm Sean Vincent by the way.  I program computers.  I even make a living doing so if you can believe that!  I mostly work in <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure(script)</a> because it (they?) is (are?) better than anything else I've come across so far.</p>
    <h2>Some stuff I've done or am doing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/sudoku/index.html">Sudoku</a>
        <p>Come solve some sudoku puzzles!  Randomly generated; configurable difficulty; pretty colors!</p>
